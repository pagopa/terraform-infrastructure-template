# kubernetes-infrastructure

This is a kubernetes infrastructure configuration.

## Requirements

### 1. terraform

In order to manage the suitable version of terraform it is strongly recommended to install the following tool:

- [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv): **Terraform** version manager inspired by rbenv.

Once these tools have been installed, install the terraform version shown in:

- .terraform-version

After installation install terraform:

```sh
tfenv install
```

### 2. Azure CLI

In order to authenticate to Azure portal and manage terraform state it's necessary to install and login to Azure subscription.

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

After installation login to Azure:

```sh
az login
```

### 3. kubectl

In order to run commands against Kubernetes clusters it's necessary to install kubectl.

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### 4. helm

In order to use Helm package manager for Kubernetes it's necessary to install helm.

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/)

### 5. Access to bastian host (jumpbox)

We deploy a kubernetes in private mode so it is not public accessible.
We use an SSH connection to a bastian host started on demand (jumpbox).

```sh
## ~/.ssh/config file configuration
# Change project_aks_env_user, user and bastian_host_env_ip with correct values
# Ask to an Azure Administrator the id_rsa_project_aks_env_user private key
Host project_aks_env_user
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  HostName bastian_host_env_ip
  User user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_project_aks_env_user
```

```sh
# set rw permission to id_rsa_project_aks_env_user key only for current user
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_project_aks_env_user
# if nedded, restart ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

## Terraform modules

As PagoPA we build our standard Terraform modules, check available modules:

- [PagoPA Terraform modules](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aterraform-modules+org%3Apagopa&type=repositories)

## Setup configuration

Before first use we need to run a setup script to configure `.bastianhost.ini` and download kube config.

```sh
bash scripts/setup.sh ENV-PROJECT

# example for CSTAR project in DEV environment
bash scripts/setup.sh DEV-CSTAR
```

## Apply changes

To apply changes use `terraform.sh` script as follow:

```sh
bash terraform.sh apply|plan|destroy ENV-PROJECT

# example to apply configuration for CSTAR project in DEV environment
bash terraform.sh apply DEV-CSTAR
```

## Terraform lock.hcl

We have both developers who work with your Terraform configuration on their Linux, macOS or Windows workstations and automated systems that apply the configuration while running on Linux.
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/providers/lock.html#specifying-target-platforms

So we need to specify this in terraform lock providers:

```sh
terraform init

rm .terraform.lock.hcl

terraform providers lock \
  -platform=windows_amd64 \
  -platform=darwin_amd64 \
  -platform=linux_amd64
```

## Precommit checks

Check your code before commit.

https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install

```sh
pre-commit run -a
```

## Terraform docs

Autogenerate Terraform documentation

https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs#installation

```sh
terraform-docs markdown . --sort-by required > README.md
```
